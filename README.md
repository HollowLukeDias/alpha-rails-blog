## About The Project

This is my first website, the first time I try MVC and CRUD. I am learning so much right now, it truly is great!
I started learning Ruby some months ago, and now I finally started Ruby on Rails, I tested some stuff and deployed it heroku!
I want to keep learning Ruby and continue creating new and better apps, so I can become a great developer!
